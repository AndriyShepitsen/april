<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2> 
<hr/>
<dl>
<dt>What is a short sale?</dt>
A short sale in real estate occurs when the outstanding loans against a property are greater than what the property can be sold for.

<dt>What if my home is worth more than my loans, but I could not pay the closing costs?</dt>
<dd>That can still be a short sale.</dd>

<dt>Who will pay your commission?</dt>
<dd>The bank will. You will pay us $0.</dd>

<dt>Who will pay the attorney / Title Company?</dt>
<dd>The bank will.  The attorneys and Title Companies we work with will NEVER send you a bill.  Even if the property does not sell.</dd>

<dt>How much work will this take?</dt>
<dd>Not much for you. We will ask you to gather certain financial information and forms for us. We will handle the negotiations with your banks.</dd>

<dt>Will my neighbors, friends or family know?</dt>
<dd>NO. Unlike a foreclosure, (which is public knowledge) the short sale private.  We will NOT tag your home as a short sale on the MLS either.  This is done to pad some Realtors stats, but could be directly tagged back to you.</dd>

<dt>If I am going through foreclosure, can I do a short sale?</dt>
<dd>YES. In fact, the bank will be more than happy to work with you on a short sale. It is to the banks and your advantage to work out a short sale.</dd>

<dt>Why is it to my advantage to do a short sale?</dt>
<dd>A foreclosure will hurt your credit far far more.  Credit Repair will be much easier after a Short Sale than after a Foreclosure. </dd>

<dt>Can I stay in my house until the short sale is completed?</dt>
<dd>YES. You will not have to move out until the closing.</dl></dd>
