<h2>Short Sale for Buyer</h2>
    <hr/>
    <p>During a short sale, homeowners agree to sell a house for less than the amount owed on the mortgage loan. This type of sale requires the lender to approve of the deal. While short sales sometimes leave sellers owing money to the lender, they also provide an alternative to foreclosure. In addition to helping the seller protect their credit, short sales offer a number of benefits to buyers.</p>
    <h4 class="subheader">Pros of Short Sales for Buyer</h4>
<hr/>
<ol class="shortSaleVSForeclosure">
  <li>Can typically purchase property 15%+ under market value</li>
  <li>May not have to put any Earnest Money down for awhile, but still have involvement with property</li>
  <li>Viable way to put in offers on lots of inventory and not have to close all at once; easy to fill the pipeline</li>
  <li>Ability to perhaps have influence of purchase price of the home and negotiate worth</li>
  <li>A lot of buyers don’t like short sales; access to inventory others won’t touch or don’t understand.</li>
</ol>
<h4 class="subheader">Cons of Short Sales for Buyers</h4>
<hr/>
<ol class="shortSaleVSForeclosure">

    <li>Property may go to foreclosure due to lack of Listing Agents experience, bad approvals, etc.</li>
    <li>Approvals may require you to hold property for 30-120 days after the sale, eating up profit</li>
    <li>Sellers may trash house and bank will not allow you to negotiate for any concessions or price drop</li>
    <li>Can’t typically assign the contract or wholesale a short sale</ol></li>

<p>With all this being said, it’s important to approach Sellers as to HOW you can help them make their short sale easier, and encourage them to speak to attorney, as well.</p>

<p>Beyond that, if they don’t already have one, suggest a well-known and experienced Listing Agent in their area that you know will handle their short sale proficiently.</p>

<p>There aren’t many reasons why a foreclosure is a better option for homeowners. In many cases it boils down to apathy on their part, lack of communication, or extenuating circumstances.</p>

<p>But with an experienced team, willing Seller, and amiable Lender/s, a short sale may be a foreclosure alternative that underwater homeowners can explore for their best benefit, and your boost your bottom line. </p>
