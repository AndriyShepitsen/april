<h2>Seller Benefits</h2> 
<hr/>
<ol class="shortSaleVSForeclosure">
<li><strong>Closing Rate</strong> - If you are in a position to need a Short Sale, it MUST get approved by the bank.
Realtor Average - 21%
Our Short Sale Group 83%</li>

<li><strong>Negotiations</strong> - We negotiate all of our short sales in house.  Not only that, we negotiate for other Realtors (RE/MAX, Coldwell Banker, Century 21 ...) as well.  </li>
<br/>
<li><strong>We will give you a minimum of $500 out of our own pockets at closing.</strong>  This is completely approved by the State of Illinois - Department of Professional Regulation.</li>
<br/>
<li><strong>You will not lose, or have a lien on any other home you own.</strong> If you do not succeed in any aspect  of the short sale, the bank(s) will come after all of your assets.</li>
<br/>
<li><strong>Your credit will recover in as little as 2 years.</strong>  This is far better than the 7 to 10 years that most homeowners in your situation will face.</li>
<br/>
<li><strong>You will not have to go in to Foreclosure.</strong>  That is what happens to over 80% of the home sellers that are in your situation.</li>
<br/>
<li><strong>You will not have to go in to Bankruptcy. </strong> This is exactly what will happen to you if you do not have the $$to pay the bank back the shortage.</li>
<br/>
<li><strong>You will not have to pay the attorney, title company, appraiser, or your Realtor (us) 1 penny.</strong>  Most home sellers still must pay many of these expenses, thus costing them $1000s.</li>
<br/>
<li><strong>You get an entire team to assist you. Not just 1 agent running around like a chicken without its head.</strong></li>
<br/>
<li><strong>You will not have to pay taxes on the default amount of money.</strong>  Marc is a Certified Public Accountant and will assist you.</li>
